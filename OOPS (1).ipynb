    "'''Ans.\n",
    "Here are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) explained in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation:  \n",
    "This means keeping all the data (like variables) and actions (like functions) related to an object together in one place, called a class. It also allows you to control who can use or change the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction:  \n",
    "Abstraction means showing only the important details and hiding the complicated stuff. It makes using objects simpler by focusing on what they do, not how they do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance:  \n",
    "Inheritance lets one class borrow features (like variables and functions) from another class. This helps save time and effort by reusing existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism:  \n",
    "Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It allows a single interface to represent different underlying forms (e.g., method overriding and method overloading).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Message Passing:  \n",
    "Objects talk to each other by sending messages, which are like calling functions. This helps them work together to perform tasks. \n",
